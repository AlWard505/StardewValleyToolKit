# StardewValleyToolKit
Tools to help with calculating things in stardew valley

To use this software you first need to run the "stardewvalleytoolkit.py" file
this will then open the options for tools

the first option will let you work out how much sprinkler space you have on your farm
the second will let you work out how many geodes you can buy from krobus while still having enough money to crack them all open, you can also enter the amount of geodes you currently have in your possesion so when you go to buy the geodes you can still crack them open too
the third option allows you to work out how many seeds you need to buy after a harvest
the fourth lets you look at villagers profile
this currently only allows you to see the marraige candidates birthdays and favourite gifts
